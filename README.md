The MicroPerimetry-App will have the following functionalities: 
1. Load images into the app via Drag-and-Drop
2. Sharpen, contrast or change brightness of the images
3. Segment the DRIL-Areas via Mouse-click-holding <--
4. Correct the segmentation if needed
5. Draw points in each image that correspond to each other so that these can be used for matching.
After these steps are performed (by the user of this app), the data runs through the logic that creates the XML-File with the Individualized-DRIL-Microperimetry-Coordinates.

"<--" indicates the progress of implementing the project.
