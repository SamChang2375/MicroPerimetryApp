The MicroPerimetry-App will have the following functionalities: 
1. Load images into the app via Drag-and-Drop
2. Sharpen, contrast or change brightness of the images
3. Segment the DRIL-Areas via Mouse-click-holding
4. Draw points in each image that correspond to each other so that these can be used for matching. Implement the Delete-Structure-Functionality. 
5. Correct the segmentation if needed
6. Clean the project and extend all implemented functions to all window panels. <--
7. After these steps are performed (by the user of this app), the data runs through the logic that creates the XML-File with the Individualized-DRIL-Microperimetry-Coordinates.

"<--" indicates the progress of implementing the project.
